				<h2>Dogs</h2>
				<p>Getting these two creatures was the best decision in my life. You know how they say: "Learn to find little peaces of joy every day in your life" And, I think, my dogs are really teaching me that.</p>

				<h2>Traveling</h2>
				<p>For me traveling is not only an amazing opportunity to discover new places, but also to discover new me. I can't help but imagine that I was born in the places I visit. I imagine growing up there. Activities that are very exciting for a traveller, but would be very normal, even boring for me:) Traveling gives me a chance to live many lives, which is amazing ,because one life is too short!</p>

			<div class="food">
				<h2>Food</h2>
				<p>Food is just a perfect representative of all the diversity of the life itself: very bright, with a different aftertaste, sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet..as inseparable part of different cultures of people as their native languages. For me food is a language of love also, at least that's how my grandmas always showed it- through food:) I love trying new food just as much as learning about new cultures.</p>
